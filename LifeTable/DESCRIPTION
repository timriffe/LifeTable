Description: The main function, \code{LT()}, is rather versatile, accepting
    single-age or 5-year abridged data, and with a variety of optional
    arguments. There is also a sub-function, \code{axEstimate()}, which serves
    as a wrapper for 4 different a(x) estimation methods. All functions take as
    their basic argument the M(x) vector, although the \code{LT()} function
    lets you start simply with a vector of exposures (Nx) and a vector of death
    counts (Dx) (better for smoothing). From that, all the other lifetable
    functions are estimated using a series of identities. Either an entire
    composed and rounded table can be returned, or else the individual
    un-rounded components. See further examples under individual function
    pages. Example data is also provided, as extracted from the Human Mortality
    Database in May, 2010. These data are for Ukrainian males in 1965, and are
    given in single ages and in 5-year abridged ages as well.
