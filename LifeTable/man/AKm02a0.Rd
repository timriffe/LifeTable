\title{\code{AKm02a0} estimates a0 using the Andreev-Kinkade rule of thumb.}
\usage{
AKm02a0(m0, sex = "male")
}
\arguments{
\item{m0}{the event / exposure infant mortality rate (not IMR)}

\item{sex}{either "male" or "female"}
}
\value{
a0, the estimated average age at death of those dying in the first year of life, either a single value or a vector of a_0 values.
}
\description{
\code{AKm02a0} is an auxiliary function used by version 6 of the four HMD lifetable functions, \code{ltper_AxN()}, \code{ltcoh_AxN()}, \code{ltperBoth_AxN()}, \code{ltcohBoth_AxN()}. This function calls \code{AKm02q0()} to help get the work done, since the HMD needed to adapt the Andreev-Kingkade formulas to work with the period lifetable flow.
